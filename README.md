# How to get TrustGraph working in the workshop

Written from a Macbook viewpoint.  Windows is similar but you'll have to
work out how to get things installed.

We're going to install a few software tools, and then interact
with TrustGraph and Memgraph.  You can skip the things you already have
installed.

## Things you should prepare before the workshop

- [Install necessary tools](docs/tools.md)
- [Prepare AWS](docs/prepare-aws.md)
- [Prepare to deploy](docs/prepare.md)

## Things you will do at the workshop

- [Deploy TrustGraph to AWS](docs/deploy.md)
- [Working with TrustGraph](docs/using-trustgraph.md)
- [Working with Memgraph](docs/using-memgraph.md)
- [Undeploy, delete everything deployed earlier](docs/undeploy.md)
